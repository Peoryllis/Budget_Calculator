# Budget_Calculator
Idea of a budget calculator-- built with python tkinter. Probably be using NumPy and Pandas and Matplotlib too

A budget calculator that makes budgeting easy and simple to do by keeping your income, amount of money in savings, your expenses and things desired all in one place.

Building with Python: Tkinter, NumPy, and Pandas.

While building this, I plan to learn about file reading and writing using Python to gain more advanced experience with the language

I also plan to use this project to learn how to use github
